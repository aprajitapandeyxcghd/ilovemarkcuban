                <p>This blog was made at 5 am on a random Wednesday on 4th December 2024 when a sudden surge of adulthood adrenaline streamlined
                     the obsessed and energetic young woman that I used to be once but lost it as a result of the wannabes in my generation. I 
                     should be studying for my Verilog Design end semester exam tomorrow but it's my love for mark cuban which makes me wanna
                     ace this exam and birth an academic comeback like no other. 
                     
                     The only person who ever normalized obsession was the great great Mark Cuban my idol, my God, 
                     (man the amount of cringe synonyms I could be inserting in is hfjkhfkh;qshf;dshf;hsfkh;dhfdjhfjd)</p>

                <p>I aspire to be like Mark Cuban some day and one of the primary reasons why I want to succeed in life includes having the privilege to meet Mark Cuban and be friends with him just like Iron Man and Spider Man. Oh yeah he's the Iron Man to my Spider man.</p>
